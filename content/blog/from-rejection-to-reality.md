# Enough Is Enough: Documenting My Journey from Rejection to Internship
![Rejection](https://gtmnow.com/wp-content/uploads/overcoming-sales-rejection-1024x541.jpg)
The journey to finding an internship since the summer of 2024 has been... well, let's just say it's been a learning experience. While I've kept busy with freelance prompt engineering at **Outlier.ai**, the search for a more traditional internship, including those at larger companies, hasn't been as smooth as I'd hoped. It's been inspiring to see friends and peers securing roles at places like **Meta**, **Amazon**, and **Shopify**, and honestly, it's also brought its share of moments where I've felt a little disheartened. But instead of letting those moments define my journey, I've reached a breaking point â€“ a moment of clarity where I realized that simply applying and hoping isn't enough. This isn't just another application cycle; it's a commitment to actively pursuing my goals, documenting the process, and hopefully, connecting with others who are on a similar path. It's time to turn frustration into action, and this blog is where that transformation begins.

# The Breaking Point: Why This Blog, Why Now?

Beyond just chronicling the ups and downs of my internship applications, this blog serves a more significant purpose for me as a developer, a point that really resonated with me after watching **Adrian Twarog's** video on why programmers should blog. Like he eloquently argued, a blog acts as a dynamic portfolio for developers. It provides a space to articulate my thought processes, document the technical challenges I encounter (and hopefully overcome!), and showcase my problem-solving abilities in a tangible way. By writing about my journey, inspired in part by Adrian's insights, I'm not only holding myself accountable but also solidifying my own understanding of the concepts and skills involved in the internship search and the field itself. Ultimately, this blog is an investment in my growth as a developer, a way to build my online presence, and a platform to connect with the wider tech community, echoing the importance Adrian Twarog so clearly laid out. a
