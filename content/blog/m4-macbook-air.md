After months of anticipation, I finally got my hands on the new MacBook Air M4, and let me tell you, it's been an experience worth writing about. As someone who's constantly juggling work, personal projects, and the ever-evolving demands of modern tech, choosing the right daily driver is crucial. And the M4 Air? It might just be the answer.



# First Impressions

From the moment I unboxed the MacBook Air M4, Apple's signature attention to detail was evident. The sleek, unibody design feels incredibly premium, and the weight (or lack thereof) is truly impressive. Picking it up, you immediately appreciate its portability. The new Sky Blue color option is also a subtle yet refreshing touch. Firing it up, the Liquid Retina display immediately captivated me with its vibrant colors and crisp text. It’s an instant upgrade for anyone coming from an older laptop, and even compared to many high-end Windows machines, the visual experience is often superior.



# Performance and Benchmarks

Now, let's talk about the heart of the matter: performance. The M4 chip is a beast, especially for a fanless laptop. I've been running it through its paces, and the results have been consistently impressive.

For web development, tasks like compiling large SASS files, running local servers, and managing multiple browser tabs are incredibly fluid. In various browser benchmarks, the M4 Air often outperforms even high-spec Windows laptops. For instance, in Speedometer 3.1, a common web benchmark, the M4 MacBook Air often scores significantly higher than many Intel Core Ultra or Snapdragon X Elite-equipped Windows laptops, providing a snappier and more responsive development environment.

In software development, compiling code, running virtual machines (with ARM versions of Windows or Linux), and handling demanding IDEs like Xcode or Visual Studio Code have been surprisingly efficient. While precise benchmarks vary depending on the specific application and code base, the M4's single-core performance, in particular, is a standout. Geekbench 6 single-core scores for the M4 MacBook Air can reach over 3700, often surpassing many Intel Core Ultra 7 200 series and even some Snapdragon X Elite processors found in Windows machines. This translates directly to faster build times and a smoother overall development workflow.

The advent of running AI models locally on consumer hardware is exciting, and the M4 Air delivers here too. While it's not a MacBook Pro with an M4 Max, the M4 chip, especially with increased unified memory configurations (up to 32GB now), can handle smaller AI models surprisingly well. For example, running a 32B parameter model like Deepseek-R1-Distill-32B at Q5 quantization is feasible on a 32GB M4 MacBook Air, using slightly over half the RAM and leaving room for other tasks. While dedicated GPUs in high-end Windows gaming laptops will still offer superior raw power for intensive AI training, the M4's neural engine provides impressive efficiency for on-device inference and lighter AI workloads without the fan noise or power consumption.

And for students, this laptop is a dream. From taking notes and researching to running simulations or editing multimedia projects, the M4 Air handles it all with ease. Its instant-on capability, silent operation, and exceptional battery life make it ideal for long study sessions.

# Softwate and Ecosystem

MacOS continues to impress with its intuitive interface and seamless integration across Apple's ecosystem. Features like Universal Control, AirDrop, and Handoff truly enhance productivity and create a cohesive experience across my iPhone, iPad, and now, my M4 MacBook Air. The app ecosystem is robust, with a vast array of optimized applications that leverage the M4's architecture for superior performance. While Windows offers a broader range of legacy software and gaming titles, for creative professionals and general productivity, macOS and its optimized applications are a joy to use.



# Usage in real-world scenarios

My daily routine involves a mix of coding, writing, video conferencing, and content consumption. The MacBook Air M4 has effortlessly handled everything I've thrown at it. Video calls are crystal clear thanks to the improved 12MP webcam and Center Stage feature, making online meetings a much more pleasant experience than on many Windows laptops. Multitasking is a breeze, even with multiple demanding applications open simultaneously. And the battery life? It's simply outstanding. I've consistently achieved over 14 hours of mixed use, meaning I can often go a full workday without needing to worry about finding an outlet – a significant advantage over many similarly priced Windows ultrabooks.



# Why Macbooks are a better value than a Windows Laptop

While Windows laptops offer a wider range of configurations and price points, the MacBook Air M4 presents a compelling value proposition, especially when considering the total cost of ownership and overall user experience.

- Performance-to-Price Ratio: The base M4 MacBook Air, starting at $999 (for the 13-inch model), often outperforms Windows laptops in single-core CPU benchmarks at similar price points. While some high-end Snapdragon X Elite or AMD Strix Point Windows laptops might slightly edge out the M4 in multi-core performance when plugged in, they often come at a significantly higher cost and with fans.

- Efficiency and Battery Life: Apple Silicon's efficiency is unmatched. As mentioned, 14+ hours of real-world battery life on a fanless laptop is a game-changer. Equivalent Windows laptops often struggle to achieve similar longevity without compromising on performance or packing larger, heavier batteries. For instance, in 4K video playback tests, the M4 MacBook Air can achieve over 14 hours, while some comparable Windows laptops might offer around 10-12 hours, with some exceptions like the Asus Zenbook A14 nearing 20 hours but with less processing power.

- Build Quality and Longevity: MacBooks are renowned for their premium build quality, which translates to better durability and a longer lifespan. This means you're likely to get more years of reliable use out of a MacBook Air, potentially offsetting a higher initial cost compared to some cheaper Windows alternatives.

- Software Updates and Ecosystem: Apple's commitment to long-term software support and the seamless integration of its ecosystem provide a cohesive and enjoyable user experience that's hard to replicate on Windows.

# In short

The MacBook Air M4 is more than just an incremental update; it's a testament to Apple's continued innovation in personal computing. Its blend of stunning design, phenomenal performance, exceptional battery life, and a robust software ecosystem makes it a truly compelling option. Whether you're a student, a developer, or simply someone looking for a reliable and powerful everyday laptop, the M4 MacBook Air is, in my opinion, a truly worthwhile investment and a benchmark that many Windows laptops are still striving to meet.
