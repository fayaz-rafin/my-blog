## Why choose the Air over the Pro?

q
The MacBook Air stands out primarily because of its lightweight design and more affordable price point. Since both the Air and the Pro models are powered by the M4 chip, you'll experience nearly identical performance for most everyday tasks. While the Pro does offer a slight edge—thanks to its built-in fan and the availability of higher-end M4 Pro and M4 Max chips—this extra power is only noticeable during extremely demanding workloads, such as heavy software development, video editing, or 3D rendering. For the majority of users, the Air provides more than enough performance without the extra cost or weight.
